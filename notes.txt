Objectives.
    1. Evolve attributes to properties.
    2. Adapt ORM methods to validate ojbject state with properties.

Updating the companies data model to add some constrains on the Department and Employee attributes.

    1.The department name and location must be non-empty strings.
    2. The Employee name and job title must be a non-empty strings.
    3. The Employee department_id must ba a foreign key refernce to a department object that had been parsisted 
    to the database.

we'll evolve the attributes to be mamaged by property methods with setter methods that ensure the attributes are assigned valid values.
evolve the deparment class to add property methds to manage the name and location attributes.
the setter methods will check for non-empty string values prior to updating the object state.

we will also update the Employee class to add property methods to manage the name, job_title and department_id attributes.
Note that the department_id setter methods check to ensure we are assignign a valid department by checking the foreign key referne in the database.
